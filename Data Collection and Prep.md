In this project I will be using the Chicago Face Database as my main dataset.

The dataset is composed of various sections.

I will be focused on the main CFD folder. This folder contains pictures of individuals of 4 different ethnics groups: Asian, Black, Latin and White. Each group is divided in Females and Males.

I am going to collect two sets of data:

1. **Observed frecuencies:** are the actual number of individuals aged over 60 in each age group in your dataset.

2. **Expected frecuencies:** are what you would expect if there was no age bias.
