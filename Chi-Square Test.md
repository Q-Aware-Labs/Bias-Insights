A chi-square test is used to compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies. The Chi-Square test will give you a p-value that you can use to determine whether the difference between the observed and expected frequencies is statistically significant.

The formula to execute the chi-square test is:

OF = Observed Frequency
EF = Expected Frequency

My data:

In each etnic group is expected to have at least 6 individuals aged over 60.


Observed frequency = 

Expected frequency = 7
