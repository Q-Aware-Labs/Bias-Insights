A chi-square (Goodness of fit) test is used to compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies in a dataset. The Chi-Square test will give you a p-value that you can use to determine whether the difference between the observed and expected frequencies is statistically significant.

The formula to execute the chi-square test is:

Before we start operating with the formula we need to determine some values:

**Degree of Freedom:**

Degrees of freedom are the maximum number of logically independent values, which may vary in a data sample. 
Degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting one from the number of items within the data sample.

As we have 8 categories, our Degree of Freedom is 7 (because 8 - 1).

**Observed Frequency (OF):**
The observed frequencies are the actual number of individuals in each age group in your dataset. 

**Expected Frequency (EF):**
The expected frequencies are what you would expect if there was no age bias.

To determine the actual values for OF and EF I have generated the following table:
Each ethnic group is expected to have at least 5 individuals aged over 60.
