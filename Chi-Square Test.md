A chi-square (Goodness of fit) test is used to compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies in a dataset. The Chi-Square test will give you a p-value that you can use to determine whether the difference between the observed and expected frequencies is statistically significant.

OF = Observed Frequency

EF = Expected Frequency

My data:

Each ethnic group is expected to have at least 5 individuals aged over 60.
