A chi-square (Goodness of fit) test is used to compare the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies in a dataset. The Chi-Square test will give you a p-value that you can use to determine whether the difference between the observed and expected frequencies is statistically significant.

The formula to execute the chi-square test is:

![enter image description here](https://github.com/antonyga/Bias-Insights/blob/main/Media/Chi-square%20test%20main%20formula.png?raw=true)

OF = Observed Frequency

EF = Expected Frequency

My data:

Observed frequency = TBD

Expected frequency = 7
Each ethnic group is expected to have at least 7 individuals aged over 60.
